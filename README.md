# Textarea with Line Numbers

<p align="center"> <i>I'm definitely not very good at naming projects</i> </p>

This is a simple script to add dynamic line numbers to a textarea. By adding `tln.js` and `tln.css` (or their corresponding minified versions) to an HTML file and then calling the `TLN.append_line_numbers( id )` function, the `<textarea>` with the specified ID will be *numberifiedâ„¢*.

When and if you get sick of those pesky numbers on the side of your textarea, you can call `TLN.remove_line_numbers( id )` and they'll poof out of existence, as if they were never there.

You can check the [demo](https://matheusavellar.github.io/textarea-line-numbers/demo.html), or this sample screenshot of what it looks like (with some additional CSS styling):
